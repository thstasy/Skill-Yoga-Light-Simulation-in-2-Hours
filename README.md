# Skill-Yoga-Light-Simulation-in-2-Hours
This project bridges my optics engineering background with coding, showcasing rapid integration of domain knowledge and software skills. Part of a “skill-yoga” series, it focuses on quick, interdisciplinary exercises (completed in 2 hours) to strengthen expertise and explore new domains efficiently.

Features
	•	Simulates light scattering with customizable tissue layers.
	•	Interactive web interface to adjust parameters such as wavelength, tissue properties, and more.
	•	Dynamic graph generation and downloadable simulation plots.

How to Use
	1.	Clone the Repository:
       git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skill-yoga-light-simulation.git
       cd skill-yoga-light-simulation

  2. 	Install Dependencies:
      Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries:
     	pip install -r requirements.txt

  3.  Run the App:
      python app.py
      Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000.

	4.	Simulate and Visualize:
	    Adjust parameters like tissue layer properties and wavelength using the web interface.
	    Generate and download simulation plots directly from the application.
